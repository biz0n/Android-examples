This is a tweaked version of the OrmLite example project ClickCounter
from http://ormlite.com/android/examples/

I added SimpleQueryAdapter and tweaked the example to use it as a
proof of concept for how an OrmLite query could be used like a Cursor
would be used with regular Android cursor adapters. It works fine,
but is a bit rough around the edges...
